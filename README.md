# Tribute-Page
Create a tribute page on any of your favorite personality using only HTML & CSS. Using JS is optional. 

### How to Design
- For this, you can follow the instructions given on this [website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

### How to Contribute
- Fork this Repo.
- Create a directory in this format, "YourUserName-PersonalityName". For ex, "sidanand67-SteveJobs".
- Add all your code files in that directory only.
- Push your changes and create a Pull Request.
